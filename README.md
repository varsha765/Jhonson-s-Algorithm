# Jhonson-s-Algorithm
This repository contains the python code for executing Jhonson's rule which is a widely known algorithm for optimizing a scheduling process in manufacturing. It works for n jobs on 2 machines. It calculates the makespan time using the processing time data available for various combinations of orders of the jobs in the machines and selects the particular order which results in the minimum makespan time. This is an optimization rule and has wide applications in manufacturing industries to select the order in which jobs should be processed in machines to get maximum productivity in the least time and helps avoiding unnecessary delays in production processes. 

You can enter the processing time for each job on respective machines individually and manually or the code also provides an option of passing a csv file containing the processing times of various jobs. The code will automatically process the processing time data and return the optimal sequence of jobs with the least makespan time.
